# Continual Active Self-Learning (CASL): An Active and Self-Supervised Learning Approach for Adapting Models to Domains and Tasks
This is the repository for the research on reducing the data budget required on pretraining a second layer pretrained model. Here I used active learning to reduce the data budget required in pretraining a self-supervised model
